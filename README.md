# Windows Post Install Scripts

WPIS (Windows Post Install Scripts) is a PowerShell-based setup tool designed to streamline and optimize a fresh Windows installation.

It helps users debloat unnecessary apps, automatically configure privacy and security settings, apply recommended tweaks with **O&O ShutUp10++**, and install essential software packages via **Winget**. For additional customization, it can also run the [Chris Titus Tech Windows Utility](https://christitus.com/win).

In short, WPIS reduces the time and effort needed after a clean Windows install by automating repetitive setup tasks.
